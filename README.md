[line height](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/line-height/): allows for a custom height


> installation

**note**: if you use my build of dwm, compile *this* program *after* you compile my dwm. unless i figure out a way to patch line height in the dmenu inside of dwm.

clone the repository

`git clone https://github.com/arilipm/dmenu.git`

cd into the folder `cd dmenu` and make it `sudo make clean install`
